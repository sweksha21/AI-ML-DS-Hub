The Email Spam Classifier project developed a machine learning model to accurately classify 
emails as spam or not spam, leveraging a dataset from Kaggle. Using Python, 
TensorFlow/Keras, and Sklearn, the project encompassed data preprocessing steps such as 
text cleaning, tokenization, and padding. A Bidirectional LSTM model was chosen for its ability 
to capture contextual information from email content in both directions, resulting in 
improved classification accuracy. The model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 
score metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in filtering out spam emails.
